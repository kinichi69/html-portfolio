<h1>Jacob's Favorite top 3 movies</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9426210/"><h3>Watch Weathering with you on imdb</h3></a>
<p>This anime is one of my favorites because the animation is breathtaking and also has a somewhat aestethic approach to it, the story on the other hand poses a boy running away from his hometown and ends up in an uncertain event which leads to him meeting a girl which has an ability to somehow prevent certain areas from raining but also consumes part of her life.</p>
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1663662/"><h3>Watch Pacific Rim on imdb</h3></a>
<p>This is a sci-fi action movie that consists of a breach (a portal) on the pacific ocean that connects earth to the anteverse, the homeworld for the precursor and the kaiju, which causes sudden attacks on different parts of the earth. Now humans have found a way to fight them using giant mechanized robots. </p>
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0409182/"><h3>Watch Posiedon on imdb</h3></a>
<p>One of my childhood favorite movies, the story represents a man experiencing a tragedy where the ship he is boarded on got hit by a tsunami somewhere at the mediterranean sea on newyear's eve. </p>
